"""
Imagine yourself as a data hacker in a virtual world where information is stored not in ordinary files but in hidden elements on web pages. To access this information, you need to use Selenium and a Python script to automate scrolling through an infinite list of elements. Your task is to collect all the numbers from these elements and sum them up.

Objective:
1. Initialization: Using Selenium, open the specified website http://parsinger.ru/infiniti_scroll_1/
2. Scrolling: The website has a list of 100 elements that extends as you scroll (infinity scroll).
3. Data collection: Scroll through the interactive elements to reveal all 100 items in the list. Use Keys.DOWN or methods like ActionChains(driver).
4. Aggregation: Extract all the numerical values from these elements and sum them up.
5. Submit the answer: Insert the calculated sum of the numbers into the designated field on the website.

Hints and notes:
- Be mindful of delays when loading the elements.
- The last item in the list has the class `last-of-list`. Use this to break the scrolling loop.
- Carefully examine the HTML structure of the page. This will help you understand how to locate the necessary elements.
