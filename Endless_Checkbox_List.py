Welcome, cyber ninjas! üê±‚Äçüíª Today you face a task that can be compared to finding a needle in a haystack. But not just any needle‚Äîa golden needle with a serial number, lost in an endless ocean of information.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to infiltrate the labyrinth of infinite checkboxes, appearing like mushrooms after the rain. Each checkbox is a miniature lock, opening only under one condition: its "value" attribute must be even.

üöÄ If you make a mistake, your mission fails. But if you succeed, you will receive more than just congratulations in the chat. At the bottom, a mysterious button with the class `alert_button` will appear, giving you a secret code. This code is the key to our next operation, so ninja, there is no room for error.

Task:
1. Initialization: Open the specified website (https://parsinger.ru/selenium/5.7/4/index.html) using Selenium.
2. Infinite Scrolling: The website contains a block with infinite loading of checkboxes. There are 100 containers in total, and each container has 10 checkboxes.
3. Even Selection: Select only the checkboxes with an even value attribute.
4. Alert Button: After selecting all checkboxes in all containers, a button with the class `alert_button` will appear. Click on it to trigger an alert message, which will contain the key to the task.
