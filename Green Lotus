Imagine a moment when time freezes, and everything around you pauses, waiting for your action. You stand before
four buttons, each one representing your chance to change the course of events. But in this task, it's not just about clickingâ€”
you have to **hold** the button. Yes, you heard it right.

To complete this task, you must tame each button by holding it down until it turns green.
The `value="N"` of each button indicates the **minimum time in seconds (float())** that you need to hold it.

ðŸ”® Once all the buttons have turned emerald green, your patience will be rewarded: an **alert message** will appear,
containing a key to the next challenge. This key must be entered into the **Stepik** answer field to progress
further in the course.

### Task:
1. Open the website (**https://parsinger.ru/selenium/5.7/5/index.html**) using Selenium.
2. Find all **four buttons** on the page.
3. Retrieve the `value` of each button. This is the time required to hold the button.
4. Once **all buttons turn green**, an alert message will appear.

### Hint:
You will need to use methods like **ActionChains** to hold the button.

# Example:
```python
actions.click_and_hold(button).pause(hold_time).release(button).perform()
'''
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains

with webdriver.Chrome() as browser:
    browser.get('https://parsinger.ru/selenium/5.7/5/index.html')
    buttons = browser.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, 'timer_button')

    for x in buttons:
        ActionChains(browser).click_and_hold(x).pause(float(x.text)).release(x).perform()
    print(browser.switch_to.alert.text)
